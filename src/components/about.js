        <p>
        Hi, I'm Angel Ramirez, an engineer with a passion 
        for software engineering and digital signal processing. 
        I specialize in creating innovative software solutions 
        and applying mathematical techniques to analyze and enhance 
        digital signals. As an applied math student at UCLA, 
        I'm currently working on a variety of exciting projects. 
        I'm developing the Mariachi Uclatlan website, which involves 
        designing and implementing web functionalities to support our 
        community. Additionally, I'm working on a Spotify digital 
        visualizer, which aims to provide insightful and 
        interactive visual representations of music data. I'm also 
        contributing to the Spotify Car Thing software, focusing on 
        improving its functionality and user experience. I enjoy 
        solving complex problems and continuously learning new t
        echnologies to stay at the forefront of my field.
